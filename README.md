# Diabetes Prediction with Keras

A simple neural network built with Keras/TensorFlow to predict diabetes onset based on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of building, training, and evaluating a binary classification model.

## Description

This project uses a Sequential neural network to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on 8 medical predictor variables. The model is trained on the famous Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and achieves a straightforward binary classification task.

## Key Features

* **Binary Classification** - Predicts diabetes presence (yes/no)
* **Simple Neural Network** - 3-layer Sequential model architecture
* **Medical Data Analysis** - Uses real-world health metrics
* **Easy to Understand** - Perfect for beginners learning Keras
* **Model Evaluation** - Includes accuracy scoring and predictions

## Technologies Used

* **Python** 3.7+
* **TensorFlow** 2.x
* **Keras** (integrated with TensorFlow)
* **NumPy** - For data handling

## Installation Requirements

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

Or install from a requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**requirements.txt:**
```
tensorflow>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.19.0
```

## Dataset

The project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**:
- **Source**: Originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
- **Samples**: 768 patients
- **Features**: 8 medical predictor variables
- **Target**: Binary outcome (0 = no diabetes, 1 = diabetes)

### Features (Input Variables):
1. Number of pregnancies
2. Plasma glucose concentration
3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. Body mass index (BMI)
7. Diabetes pedigree function
8. Age (years)

**Download the dataset**: [pima-indians-diabetes.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv)

Place the file in the same directory as your Python script.

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keras-diabetes-prediction.git
cd keras-diabetes-prediction
```

2. Ensure the dataset file `pima-indians-diabetes.csv` is in the project directory

3. Run the script:
```bash
python diabetes_prediction.py
```

### Code Example

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
import numpy as np

# Load dataset
dataset = np.loadtxt("pima-indians-diabetes.csv", delimiter=",")
x = dataset[:,0:8]  # Features
y = dataset[:,8]    # Labels

# Create model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x, y, epochs=15, batch_size=10, verbose=2)

# Evaluate Model
score = model.evaluate(x, y)
print(f"Accuracy: {score[1]*100:.2f}%")

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(x)
```

## Configuration Options

### Model Architecture

You can modify the neural network structure:

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(16, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))  # Increase neurons
model.add(Dense(12, activation='relu'))               # Add more layers
model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
```

### Training Parameters

Adjust these hyperparameters for different results:

```python
model.fit(
    x, y,
    epochs=20,        # Increase for more training
    batch_size=32,    # Larger batch size for faster training
    validation_split=0.2,  # Add validation data
    verbose=1         # Show progress bar
)
```

### Optimizer Options

Try different optimizers:

```python
model.compile(
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    optimizer='sgd',      # Or 'rmsprop', 'adagrad'
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
```

## Expected Output

```
Epoch 1/15
77/77 - 0s - loss: 5.4219 - accuracy: 0.6445
Epoch 2/15
77/77 - 0s - loss: 1.1872 - accuracy: 0.6536
...
Epoch 15/15
77/77 - 0s - loss: 0.5234 - accuracy: 0.7461

24/24 [==============================] - 0s 1ms/step
accuracy 74.61
```

The model typically achieves around **70-78% accuracy** on this dataset.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: `FileNotFoundError: pima-indians-diabetes.csv`
- **Solution**: Make sure the dataset file is in the same directory as your script

**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'`
- **Solution**: Install TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow`

**Problem**: Low accuracy (below 60%)
- **Solution**: Try increasing epochs, adjusting learning rate, or normalizing the data

**Problem**: Model overfitting
- **Solution**: Add validation split and implement early stopping:
```python
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

early_stop = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3)
model.fit(x, y, epochs=50, validation_split=0.2, callbacks=[early_stop])
```

### GPU Support

To use GPU acceleration (if available):
```python
# TensorFlow will automatically use GPU if available
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```
